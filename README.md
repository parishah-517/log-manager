# log manager
Log Entry Manager in C++

I created a program that reads an input file containing log entries, and then enters an interactive mode where the user can perform timestamp, category, and keyword searches for the purpose of constructing an "excerpt list" of the log file

I worked with multiple interacting data structures: vectors, deques, unordered maps, comparators 

I've uploaded the sample input/output files I was given to test my implementation on

To view my implementation, email me at shahpari@umich.edu. I'm not able to make my code public due to academic integrity since this project was a course assignment
